The proposed framework is distributed in nature, making it scalable to large-scale multi-agent systems. |

LLM-based high-level planner assigns a leader for the MRS, resulting in a leader-follower formation. A GNN-based lowlevel controller provides a distributed control policy for safety and connectivity while the leader helps evade the deadlock. |

We visualize the learned GCBF for the blue agent and draw the edges with its neighboring agents in grey. The learned GCBF can handle arbitrary graph topologies and hence can scale to an arbitrary number of agents without retraining.

The QP controller needs to be perturbed consistently, because multiple robot agents might still be acting against each other with random perturbations. Inspired by the traffic rule used in transportation to resolve conflicts [32], [33], the following consistent perturbation method is proposed to resolve different deadlocks |
