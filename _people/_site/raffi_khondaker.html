<p>Hello! I am an undergraduate studying Math and Computer Science with an interest in Vision/Control. 
My current project involves learning to represent a Control Barrier Function as an implicit neural representation of a 3D scene to inform safe robot actions.
Beyond that, I am the Projects/education lead at Machine Learning @ UVA and a Resident Advisor at JMW.</p>
